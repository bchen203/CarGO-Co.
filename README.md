1) This file [CarGO_Co.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k8azH72ajFuV4qa9EQ2fr0EouEPoD1Xb/view?usp=drive_link) contains evidence of our efforts to plan our elicitation of requirements from Mr. Keogh, and any notes taken during the elicitation.
2) This file [CarGO_CoProjectPitchORIGINAL.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SwNXSIQbf5PmzQHZAJMXbSK73pQisVSl/view?usp=drive_link) contains our original pitch to Mr. Keogh, which was delivered on 6:30pm on Monday, November 4th, 2024.
3) This file [CarGO_CoProjectPitchCORRECTED.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yilMQILYlT_vgx3kC1Zy8xW9L-lFb603/view?usp=drive_link) contains a new version of the pitch, with all the corrections, amendments and deletions suggested by Mr. Keogh (and/or Dr. Keogh). This version also contains a scan of the wet-ink signed contract between CarGO Co. and John Keogh.
4) This file [CarGO_CoDesign.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cf-V98lgEvkXtJEZvJEaGNLaCzscSkd2/view?usp=drive_link) shows evidence of our efforts to design our software.
5) This file [CarGO_CoTesting.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k3c90AIDbBJwvwktILQv7_tOcxURz_Oe/view?usp=drive_link) which shows evidence of our efforts to test our software.
6) This URL [https://github.com/bchen203/CargoCo](https://github.com/bchen203/CargoCo) points to a GitHub repository of our code.
7) This YouTube video, that shows our software solving one balance, and one transfer test case (our choices, of the test cases Mr. Keogh gave us).
8) This text file, is the [Logfile] log that was created by our software, during the making of the YouTube video in the previous bullet point.
9) We would like to point out the following limitations:
 - We did not implement heuristics in either balance or load/offload, so our program begins to lag above 10, and hangs at around 25 containers.
 - We did not implement the buffer.
 - Because we did not implement the buffer, we could not implement SIFT.
10) Here is some additional items you may find useful in grading the project:
 - Our recordings of ourselves working on the code is in the following folder: [Coding Recordings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EnAzyScByTH-xV-R-nzwLkKr7LVadN-J?usp=sharing)
 - The executable file to run our program is in the Releases tab on the right.
11) We would like to acknowledge the following resources that where helpful in completing this project:
    - We asked advice from Dr. Keogh about implementing heuristics and uniform cost search to our balance and load/offload operations on Wednesday, December 4th.
    - We looked through [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) for information on python libraries and how to use tkinter.
    - We also used [TkDocs](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/) for more info on how to use tkinter. We used [Stack Overflow ](https://stackoverflow.com/)for general debugging tips.
    - We looked through this Stack Overflow [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12203676/daylight-savings-time-in-python) about implementing daylight savings time with Python's timezones.
    - We looked through this Stack Overflow  [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68718968/using-datetime-to-print-a-couple-of-days-into-the-future) to help us test that the correct year is being added to the log and the filename is correct for future years.
    - We looked through this Stack Overflow [post](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-python-script-to-exe-file/) about compiling and bundling all of our files into a singular.exe file.
