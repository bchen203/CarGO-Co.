1) This file [CarGO_Co.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k8azH72ajFuV4qa9EQ2fr0EouEPoD1Xb/view?usp=drive_link) contains evidence of our efforts to plan our elicitation of requirements from Mr. Keogh, and any notes taken during the elicitation.
2) This file [CarGO_CoProjectPitchORIGINAL.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SwNXSIQbf5PmzQHZAJMXbSK73pQisVSl/view?usp=drive_link) contains our original pitch to Mr. Keogh, which was delivered on 6:30pm on Monday, November 4th, 2024.
3) This file [CarGO_CoProjectPitchCORRECTED](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yilMQILYlT_vgx3kC1Zy8xW9L-lFb603/view?usp=drive_link) contains a new version of the pitch, with all the corrections, amendments and deletions suggested by Mr. Keogh (and/or Dr. Keogh)
4) This file [CarGO_CoDesign.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cf-V98lgEvkXtJEZvJEaGNLaCzscSkd2/view?usp=drive_link) shows evidence of our efforts to design our software.
5) This file [] which shows evidence of our efforts to test our software.
6) This URL [https://github.com/bchen203/CargoCo](https://github.com/bchen203/CargoCo) points to a GitHub repository of our code.
7) This YouTube video, that shows our software solving one balance, and one transfer test case (our choices, of the test cases Mr. Keogh gave us).
8) This text file, is the [Logfile] log that was created by our software, during the making of the YouTube video in the previous bullet point.
9) We would like to point out the following limitations:
 - We did not implement heuristics in either balance or load/offload, so our program []
 - We did not implement duplicate name substitution. So, if there are duplicate named containers, and a user requests one of them, we will retrieve the one she asked for
literally, even if one of the duplicates would have been cheaper to retrieve
 - We did not implement the buffer.
 - Because we did not implement the buffer, we could not implement SIFT
10) (EK says, this is optional) Here is some additional items you may find useful in grading the project
11) 1) (EK says, this is optional) We would like to acknowledge the following resources that where helpful in completing this project. We asked advice from Dr. Smith about
heuristics. We watched this YouTube video , about user interface design, we got many ideas about elicitation of requirements from this book Simply Put!: Helping Stakeholders Discover and Define Requirements for IT Projects by Thomas Hathaway. We looked through [GeeksforGeeks](geeksforgeeks.org) for information on python libraries and how to use tkinter. We also used [TkDocs](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/) for more info on how to use tkinter. We used [Stack Overflow ](https://stackoverflow.com/)for general debugging tips.
